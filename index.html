                    <p> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Abdul Kalam was born into a poor Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage town
                        of Rameswaram,
                        Tamil
                        Nadu, on October 15, 1931. His mother, Ashiamma, was a housewife and his father, Jainulabdeen,
                        was
                        an imam of a local mosque and a boat owner. He was the youngest in the family with four elder
                        brothers and a sister. </p>

                    <p> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Though, the family was not financially affluent yet all the children were
                        raised in an
                        atmosphere
                        that was full of love and compassion. In order to add to the family’s income, Kalam had to sell
                        newspapers during his early years. </p>

                    <p> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; He was an average student during his school, but possessed a strong desire
                        to learn and was very
                        hard working. He loved mathematics and spent hours studying the subject. He pursued his
                        education
                        from ‘Schwartz Higher Secondary School,’ and then graduated from ‘Saint Joseph’s College,
                        Tiruchirappalli,’ in 1954. He wanted to become a fighter pilot but his dream could not be
                        fulfilled
                        as here were only eight positions available in the IAF and he secured the ninth place.</p>

                    <p> &emsp; &emsp;&emsp; In 1960, he graduated from the ‘Madras Institute of Technology,’ and joined
                        as a scientist at the ‘Aeronautical Development Establishment,’ after becoming a member of the
                        ‘Defence Research and Development Service.’ Kalam also worked under the eminent space scientist
                        Vikram Sarabhai while he was a part of ‘INCOSPAR’ committee. Kalam was transferred to the
                        ‘Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO)’ in 1969. He became the project head of the country’s
                        foremost Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III). In July 1980, SLV-III deployed the ‘Rohini’
                        satellite successfully near-earth orbit under Kalam’s leadership. </p>

                    <p> &emsp; &emsp;&emsp; Kalam was a part of a number of projects, including ‘Project Devil,’ in
                        1970. Though the project was not successful, yet it laid the foundation for the development of
                        the ‘Prithvi Missile,’ in 1980. He was also associated with ‘Project Valiant.’ </p>

                    <p> &emsp; &emsp;&emsp;In 1983, Kalam returned to DRDO as its chief as he was asked to lead the
                        ‘Integrated Guided Missile Development Program’ (IGMDP). </p>

                    <p> &emsp; &emsp;&emsp; In May 1998, he played a key role in carrying out ‘Porkhran-II’ nuclear
                        tests by India. The success of these nuclear tests made Kalam a national hero and his popularity
                        went skyrocketing. </p>

                    <p> &emsp; &emsp;&emsp;As a technical visionary, he made several recommendations in the fields of
                        technological innovations, agriculture, and nuclear energy to make India a developed nation by
                        2020. </p>

                    <p> &emsp; &emsp;&emsp; In 2002, Kalam was chosen the Presidential nominee by the ruling National
                        Democratic Alliance (NDA), and he was elected the President. He became the 11th President of
                        India on July 25, 2002 and served the position till July 25, 2007. </p>

                    <p> &emsp; &emsp;&emsp; He also became the third President of India to have received ‘Bharat Ratna’
                        before assuming the office of the President. </p>

                    <p> &emsp; &emsp;&emsp;Due to his style of working and interaction with common people, especially
                        the youth, he was affectionately called ‘The People’s President.’ According to Dr. Kalam, the
                        most arduous decision he had taken during his tenure was that of signing the ‘Office of Profit
                        Bill.’ </p>

                    <p> &emsp; &emsp;&emsp; During his tenure as President, he faced criticism for his inaction in
                        deciding the fate of mercy petitions that were submitted to him. Out of the 21 mercy petitions,
                        he acted only on one mercy plea. In 2005, he recommended for President’s rule in Bihar, which
                        also became a controversial decision. </p>

                        Indore,’ and the ‘Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Shillong.’ He served as a professor of

                    <p> &emsp; &emsp;&emsp;Kalam went to IIM Shillong to deliver a lecture on ‘Creating a Livable Planet
                        Earth,’ on July 27, 2015. While climbing a flight of stairs, he expressed some discomfort, but
                        made his way to the auditorium. Only five minutes into the lecture, around 6:35pm IST, he
                        collapsed in the lecture hall. He was taken to ‘Bethany Hospital’ in a critical condition. He
                        was kept in the intensive care unit but lacked signs of life. At 7:45pm IST, he was declared
                        dead due to cardiac arrest. </p>

                    <p> &emsp; &emsp;&emsp; Kalam’s body was airlifted in an Indian Air Force helicopter and was flown
                        to New Delhi on July 28. Numerous dignitaries and masses paid homage to him at his residence at
                        10 Rajaji Marg. Kalam’s body, wrapped in the national flag, was then flown to the town of
                        Mandapam, from where an army truck took it to his home town of Rameswaram. His body was
                        displayed at Rameswaram in front of a bus station to allow people to pay their last respect to
                        the departed soul. On July 30, 2015, the former President was laid to rest with full state
                        honours at Rameswaram’s Pei Karumbu Ground. Kalam’s last rites were attended by more than
